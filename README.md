# SudokuGame
Here I will show you the Sudoku game

The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of eighty one squares.
The grid is split into 9 blocks, every containing nine squares.

The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has got to contain all the values 1-9 among its squares. every number will solely seem once in a very row, column or box.

The issue lies therein each vertical nine-square column, or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square, must additionally contain the numbers 1-9, while not repetition or omission.

Every puzzle has only one correct solution.

I programmed  this game in Python language and i converted all of these Rules into functions in python...
